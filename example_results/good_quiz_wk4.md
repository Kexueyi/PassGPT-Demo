Certainly! Based on the provided course content on "Traditional Machine Learning Methods and NLP Applications" from Week 4, I'll create a set of practice questions for you to better understand the key concepts. Here are five context questions and five code questions along with the answers.

### Context Questions

#### Question 1
What is a feature in the context of machine learning models?

A) A type of model used exclusively in NLP
B) The input variable used in making predictions
C) The output or prediction made by a model
D) A specific type of algorithm used for data processing

#### Answer: B) The input variable used in making predictions

#### Question 2
Which algorithm is particularly good for document classification tasks in NLP?

A) k-Means Clustering
B) Random Forest
C) Naive Bayes
D) Linear Regression

#### Answer: C) Naive Bayes

#### Question 3
What is overfitting in machine learning?

A) When a model performs equally well on training and testing datasets
B) When a model performs poorly on both new and training data
C) When a model performs too well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data
D) When a model is too slow to train on large datasets

#### Answer: C) When a model performs too well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data

#### Question 4
Why is tokenization important in NLP?

A) It helps in reducing the size of the text data
B) It allows the machine to read text
C) It breaks the text into parts that can be individually analyzed
D) It improves the speed of text processing

#### Answer: C) It breaks the text into parts that can be individually analyzed

#### Question 5
Which method can be used to convert text data into numerical format?

A) Tokenization
B) Regularization
C) Vectorization
D) Serialization

#### Answer: C) Vectorization

### Code Questions

#### Question 6
What does the following Python code using Scikit-learn accomplish?
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
corpus = ["Text data is powerful", "NLP applications are widespread"]
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
```
A) Tokenizes the 'corpus'
B) Counts the occurrence of each word in the 'corpus'
C) Sorts the words in the 'corpus' alphabetically
D) None of the above

#### Answer: B) Counts the occurrence of each word in the 'corpus'

#### Question 7
Given the following line of code, which ML model is being used?
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
```
A) Decision Tree
B) Naive Bayes
C) Random Forest
D) Logistic Regression

#### Answer: C) Random Forest

#### Question 8
What does this Python code snippet demonstrate in an NLP context?
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.20, random_state=42)
```
A) Tokenization
B) Model evaluation
C) Data splitting
D) Vectorization

#### Answer: C) Data splitting

#### Question 9
Identify the purpose of the following code:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
y_pred = [0, 2, 1, 3]
y_true = [0, 1, 2, 3]
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
```
A) Calculating the model’s prediction accuracy
B) Computing the count of predictions
C) Sorting prediction results
D) Generating prediction labels

#### Answer: A) Calculating the model’s prediction accuracy

#### Question 10
What task is being performed by the following Python code in an NLP setting?
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
docs = ["data mining", "data analysis", "big data"]
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer()
result = tfidf.fit_transform(docs)
```
A) Data clustering
B) Generating a bag of words model
C) Applying TF-IDF to document term matrices
D) None of the above

#### Answer: C) Applying TF-IDF to document term matrices

These questions should help you gauge your understanding and test your knowledge on Traditional Machine Learning Methods and NLP Applications as covered in Week 4 of the course.
