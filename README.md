## Environment
The packages are listed in requirements.txt. Run the following command for setting up the environment:
```bash
conda create --name pgpt --file requirements.txt
conda activate pgpt
```

## Motivation
1. To mitigate the gap between general version of GPT and course-specific GPT
2. To provide a more efficient way to generate course-specific content
3. To provide a more interactive way to learn

## Functions
1. Generate course-specific content. e.g. course structure, concepts, and examples
2. Course information retrieval. e.g. course schedule, course materials, and course announcements
3. Study & review assistance. e.g. summarize, simulate quizzes
