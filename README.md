# PassGPT
A course-specific chat model powered by GPT. Make you learn efficiently and Pass! Let's meet PassGPT!

![Working Flow of PassGPT](figure/intro.png)

## Motivation
1. To mitigate the gap between general version of GPT and course-specific GPT
2. To provide a more efficient way to generate course-specific content
3. To provide a more interactive way to learn

## Functions
1. Generate course-specific content. e.g. course structure, concepts, and examples
2. Course information retrieval. e.g. course schedule, course materials, and course announcements
3. Study & review assistance. e.g. summarize, simulate quizzes

## Challenges
1. Data collection: slides to training text(OCR), codes, announcements(python fetch),quizs
2. How to label the data?  
3. How to fine-tune GPT to our downstream tasks?

### Data Preprocssing

#### Goal
We need course available information in a well-structed data formï¼š
1. Material Type: slides, codes, announcements, quizzes
2. Teaching Week: week 1, week 2, ..., week n
3. Topic
4. Subtopic
5. Key Concepts
6. Formula
7. Code Example
